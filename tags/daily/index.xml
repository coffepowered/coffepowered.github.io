      <description>A radar (or spider) chart is a convenient method of displaying multivariate data in a form of 2-dimensional chart.
When I say convenient, I mean it is particularly well-accepted by people and gives a good intuition when comparing different items/subjects.
Think about comparing 2 (or more) football players in terms of dribbling, running speed, shots and pressure. Even with only four variables bar plot would become cumbersome to deal with and not immediate to perceive.</description>

      <description>Quite often, it is needed to fill or modify dataframes with data that gets computed at runtime. This post draws heavily from the stackoverlow question &amp;ldquo;Add one row to pandas DataFrame&amp;rdquo;. Here I show the 4 methods that were proposed to append the data and discuss them. A 5th &amp;ldquo;improper&amp;rdquo; method operating on columns is added just for sake of comparison with respect to the most efficient option.
If you want just the takeaways:</description>
