      <description>Google announced Tuesday its results for Q4 2021 and that they plan to split shares at 20 for 1 this Tuesday. Basically, if you are a shareholder, for each 1 share of Google at (about) 3000$ dollars you will have (at the ex-date) 20 shares at 150$.&#xA;Nothing should really change, but there might be some financial effects, for instance, due to the inclusion of the stock in new indices or increased market liquidity.</description>
