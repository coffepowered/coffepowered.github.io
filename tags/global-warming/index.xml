      <description>I can remember the snow Born on the cusp of the 90s, I was privileged to witness a period of great optimism and progress. The winds of freedom and democracy seemed to be blowing strong, and economies were thriving. One particularly noteworthy achievement from this time was the establishment of the Montreal Protocol, a treaty designed to phase out ozone-depleting substances, a move that has proven highly successful.
I have fond memories of being a child during this time, including TV commercials1 that highlighted the importance of protecting polar bears.</description>
