                            <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Here, I just scratch the surface of NLP, by commenting <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19r9OS9SoBJMXM9GqAXgu6UEZSLwAqoM1?usp=sharing">my colab notebook which builds the backend</a> of a sentiment movie review app from the ground up exploiting Keras' TextVectorization.</p>

<p>You are expected to be familiar with the following concepts and tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basics of Machine learning and data manipulation: did you try the Titanic dataset?</li>
<li>Basics of Keras API: you got at least on neural network with Keras tutorial</li>
</ul>

<p>I will try to provide crash-course on word vectors and text vectorization.</p>

<h2 id="turning-words-into-numbers-text-vectorization">Turning Words into numbers: Text vectorization</h2>

<p>A computer can naturally manipulate and operate on numeric representations of entities but not on text or strings. Understanding and managing effectively at least one way of translating text into numbers-useful-for Machine Learning, should be in the tool belt of any ML practitioner.</p>

<h3 id="data-representation-the-need-for-good-word-vectors">Data representation: the need for good word vectors</h3>

<p>Think of performing a regression: you want to associate a numeric output (y) to numeric inputs (X). The definition of (X) is easy when you have <strong>tabular</strong> data, i.e. the kind of data which is stored in an Excel spreadsheet or in a database. An example could be predicting the value of a used car (y) depending on its age (x1), kilometers (x2) and horsepower (x3) <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To improve your predictions, you may also want to include a non-numeric attribute, as the car market segment (Compact, Suv, Wagon)? In this case, the information is available as a string but numeric representations are well-established and easy to create, as <em>one-hot-encoding</em>, which associates to each car (c) a 3D vector (i,j,k) whose entries are 1 if (c) posses the attribute and 0 otherwise. So, if (c) is a compact one, its &quot;market segment&quot; attribure will be (1,0,0) while if it is a station wagon it'll be (0,0,1).</p>

<p>Now think of having also <strong>image data</strong>. A lot of information there and the technology to <em>represent</em> an image using numbers has long been there. A quite intuitive representation for a grayscale image is a 2D matrix of pixel with values ranging from 0 (white) to (255) black.
The problem with image data is that for <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-brief-history-of-computer-vision-and-convolutional-neural-networks-8fe8aacc79f3">long time it has been difficult</a> to build a model able to make sense of X to create a good (X)-&gt;(y) relationship.  Back to our value of used car example, a simple statistical model is not able to extract useful information (color, size, design) from a car image.</p>

<p>You may well be seeing where we are going. What happens when want to exploit unstructured <strong>textual</strong> data?</p>

<p>If we had to start from scratch, we may try to approach the problem by constructing one-hot-encoded word vectors.</p>

<p>Again, in our example, we may have a series of reviews associated with the car model, let's for instance take the pro &amp; cons of Fiat 500 Convertible for a concrete example of <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/fiat/500/2019/convertible/">real-world data</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nimble size for easy parking, Fairly comfortable ride quality for a car of this size, Lots of personality for the price, Disappointing fuel economy given the slow acceleration, Poor rear visibility with the convertible's top lowered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice how descriptive (and difficult to preprocess) textual data may be. We have <em>30 different vocabulary words</em> here just for a single piece of text from the data. Even if we could build those one-hot vectors there are at least 2 very clear drawbacks:</p>

<ol>
<li>the number of &quot;numeric&quot; values would be very high. In other words this representation has a very high cardinality: this is a size and computation problem<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</li>
<li>this representation is very sparse and your model can have a really hard time in finding good</li>
</ol>

<p>A possible solution to this is using Bag of Words model, another one -which I usually prefer- is via <strong>words embedding</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="words-embedding-training-from-scratch">Words embedding: training from scratch</h2>

<p>Writing... (this is connected with the original notebook, we just use movie-reviews toy problem).</p>

<h2 id="words-embedding-reuse">Words embedding: re-use</h2>

<p>Writing...</p>

<p>Remember that word embedding may shift with time!</p>

<li id="fn:1">You have probably been explosed to Linear Regression (LR). In the particular case of LR you can also solve the relation in <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc311_f20/readings/notes_on_linear_regression.pdf">closed form</a>. Anyway, what's really important here is that the inputs are already numbers.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:1"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:2">Moreover, such a representation is bad since it is not able to relate word co-occurrence: maybe having poor rear visibility is OK for convertibles but not for standard cars.
 <a class="footnote-return" href="#fnref:2"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>
<li id="fn:3">an attentive reader may wonder why just <strong>words</strong>? In fact, one could create text embedding by using n-grams.
