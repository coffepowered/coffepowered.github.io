      <description>A somewhat detailed review mixed with notes (spoiler alert) I am writing this review since in my google bubble a find a mostly unsatisfying results and when I started the course I&#39;d have loved having more first-hand experience knowing what to expect for the course1.
Online courses are targeted at wide and eterogeneous audiences, so consider this a totally subjective review as your background and sensibility may vary. A very short intro about me, so that you can try putting yourself into my shoes and weight my words: I am not a finance, economics or math graduate.</description>
