      <description>A radar (or spider) chart is a convenient method of displaying multivariate data in a form of 2-dimensional chart.&#xA;When I say convenient, I mean it is particularly well-accepted by people and gives a good intuition when comparing different items/subjects.&#xA;Think about comparing 2 (or more) football players in terms of dribbling, running speed, shots and pressure. Even with only four variables bar plot would become cumbersome to deal with and not immediate to perceive.</description>

      <title>Google 20 for 1 stock split</title>

      <description>Google announced Tuesday its results for Q4 2021 and that they plan to split shares at 20 for 1 this Tuesday. Basically, if you are a shareholder, for each 1 share of Google at (about) 3000$ dollars you will have (at the ex-date) 20 shares at 150$.&#xA;Nothing should really change, but there might be some financial effects, for instance, due to the inclusion of the stock in new indices or increased market liquidity.</description>

      <title>Short notes on namedtuples, NamedTuples and Data classes</title>

      <description>Both dataclasses and tuples are based on the attrs project, the one Python Library everybody needs and are fast object types (factory methods) designed to simplify and reduce code.&#xA;namedtuple and NamedTuple Both immutable Tuple-based (hence fast) but far better than tuples NamedTuple is the typed version of namedtuple immutable, iterable, hashable, unpackable backward-compatible with tuple (e.g you can access a namedtuple by index) default arguments supported from Python 3.7+ fast!</description>

      <description>Quite often, it is needed to fill or modify dataframes with data that gets computed at runtime. This post draws heavily from the stackoverlow question &amp;ldquo;Add one row to pandas DataFrame&amp;rdquo;. Here I show the 4 methods that were proposed to append the data and discuss them. A 5th &amp;ldquo;improper&amp;rdquo; method operating on columns is added just for sake of comparison with respect to the most efficient option.&#xA;If you want just the takeaways:</description>
