      <description>Course review Let me paraphrase what Tukey once said: I truly believe that getting in contact with different fields and expertise is one of the perks of being a data scientist. Pictorially:
The best thing about being a statistician data scientist, Mr Tukey once told a colleague, is that you get to play in everyone&amp;rsquo;s backyard.

      <title>Google 20 for 1 stock split</title>

      <description>Google announced Tuesday its results for Q4 2021 and that they plan to split shares at 20 for 1 this Tuesday. Basically, if you are a shareholder, for each 1 share of Google at (about) 3000$ dollars you will have (at the ex-date) 20 shares at 150$.
Nothing should really change, but there might be some financial effects, for instance, due to the inclusion of the stock in new indices or increased market liquidity.</description>
